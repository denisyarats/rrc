"""Run `evaluate_policy.py` with random goals for all difficulty levels

Creates a dataset of multiple pairs of random initial state and goal for the
cube for each difficulty level.  Then executes `evaluate_policy.py` on each of
these samples and collects the log files in the specified output directory.

The `evaluate_policy.py` script is expected to be located in the current
working directory.  Replace the dummy policy there with your actual policy to
evaluate it.

This is used for the evaluation of the submissions of this phase of the first
phase of the real robot challenge.  Make sure this script runs with your
`evaluate_policy.py` script without any errors before submitting your code.
"""

# IMPORTANT:  DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE!
# Submissions will be evaluate on our side with a similar script but not
# exactly this one.  To make sure that your code is compatible with our
# evaluation script, make sure it runs with this one without any modifications.
